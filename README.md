# BLOOD CONNECT
Problem Statement - Thousands of patients struggle to find compatible blood donors during emergencies due to slow, uncoordinated systems lacking real-time tracking and alerts. BLOOD CONNECT bridges this gap by providing an intelligent, real-time platform that instantly connects donors, recipients, and hospitals - ensuring faster responses and saving lives.

Purpose of the Project - The main purpose of BLOOD CONNECT is to eliminate the delay between blood requests and donor availability. Many existing systems are slow or lack proper coordination between hospitals and donors. This project aims to create a reliable  solution that leverages technology to enable instant communication, smart alerts, and live donor tracking.

How BLOOD CONNECT Works - Users can register as act as donors or recipients as per the circumstances. Donors who enable location access  to appear as available nearby. When a recipient raises a blood request, the system identifies and notifies the nearest donors of the required blood type. Emergency-level requests are prioritized with special alert indicators. For those unable to travel, BLOOD CONNECT provides a home collection feature, allowing trained medical professionals to collect and transport the blood safely under proper conditions. This ensures no donor is left out due to distance or mobility issues.

Key Features - BLOOD CONNECT offers several important features that make it unique and impactful. It provides instant donor search based on location and blood group, real-time tracking of donor availability, and emergency notifications with priority symbols to indicate urgency. (Future enhancement)The home blood collection option ensures inclusivity, while features like request tracking, donation history, and smart alerts make the platform user-friendly and efficient.

Technology Stack Used - The platform is built using modern web technologies to ensure performance and reliability. The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for design and interactivity. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, while MongoDB is used for database management. (The application also integrates Geolocation APIs for location tracking and can be hosted on platforms like GitHub, Render, or Vercel.)

User Workflow - After logging in, donors can enable their live location to appear as available nearby. Recipients can raise blood requests by selecting their required blood type and urgency level. The system automatically identifies compatible donors and notifies them instantly. Donors can then respond to the request, and the system updates the request status in real time. The donation history feature helps track previous donations and requests.

Future Enhancements - BLOOD CONNECT aims to evolve continuously with advanced features. Planned improvements include AI-based donor recommendations, integration with hospital blood banks, in-app chat between donors and recipients, and home blood connection option. These features will make the system smarter, faster, and more reliable in the long run.

Team and Coordinators - This project was developed by a dedicated team of students from Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering, Vizag, by P. Sai Babu, G Yogitha Jyothirmai, K Poojitha and G.V.D. Hasini.
The team includes coordinators for frontend design, backend development, database management, and documentation.
